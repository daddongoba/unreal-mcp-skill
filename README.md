# unreal-mcp-skill

> A battle-tested **Codely CLI skill** that drives **Unreal Engine 5.8+** through the editor's built-in MCP server — blueprint authoring, scene building, materials, Niagara, Sequencer, PCG and more, all from natural language.

## What it is

A knowledge-packed skill (not a plugin — no engine code) for [Codely CLI](https://codely-docs.tuanjie.cn) agents operating UE via Epic's **ModelContextProtocol** toolsets (67 toolsets when AllToolsets is enabled):

- **Blueprint DSL workflows** — create BPs, variables, functions, cross-BP calls, compile, PIE-verify; a Scheme-like DSL (`write_graph_dsl`) with 27 battle-tested syntax laws
- **Scene / physics / collision** — component selection rules, trigger patterns, runtime physics activation
- **Materials / UMG / Niagara / Sequencer / PCG / ControlRig / SkeletalMesh** — verified pipelines per domain
- **One-Click Connect** — `ue_connect.py` diagnoses the editor/port/plugins and launches UE for you (novice-friendly)
- **A pitfall lawbook** — 17 law-groups (G1-G17) distilled from real failure forensics: palette-name vs tool-id namespaces, cast-node naming traps, Chinese-locale display-name localization, ghost port squatters...
- **Offline node dictionary + search tools** — 1665-node dictionary + PIE-verified extras, searchable in seconds

Every rule carries a confidence tag: `[VERIFIED <date> UE<ver>-<lang>]` (PIE-proven), `[DOC]` (docs-sourced), or `[UNVERIFIED]`.

## Quick start

1. **Install the skill** — copy this folder to your Codely skills directory:
   ```
   Windows: C:\Users\<you>\.codely-cli\skills\unreal-mcp
   macOS:   ~/.codely-cli/skills/unreal-mcp
   ```
2. **Ensure a UE5.8+ project** whose `.uproject` enables these plugins (the skill can add them with your consent):
   `ModelContextProtocol` · `ToolsetRegistry` · `EditorToolset` · `PythonScriptPlugin` · `AllToolsets`
3. **Start Codely and just ask** — e.g. "连上 UE" / "connect to UE". The agent runs `scripts/ue_connect.py check` (diagnosis), then `launch` + `wait` (~4.5 min first load) — see SKILL.md → *One-Click Connect*.

> Startup order matters: **UE first, then Codely** (Codely discovers MCP tools only at its own startup). The skill's `mcp_call.py` fallback keeps you working even if the order was wrong.

## ⚠️ Known limitation: use the ENGLISH editor interface

This skill is validated against UE 5.8 running with the **English (EN) editor language**.
Do NOT switch the editor to Chinese (or another localized UI) while driving it via MCP:

- Node `type_id`s are matched against palette/registry names. In a localized editor some
  families are renamed (e.g. the Cast category `Utilities|Casting|` displays as
  `工具|Casting|` in a Chinese editor), so node creation by id silently fails.
- Every verified rule in this repo is tagged `[VERIFIED ... UE5.8-EN]` — proven on
  English-locale editors only.

**If your editor is in Chinese**: switch via `Edit → Editor Preferences → Region & Language
→ Editor Language = English`, then restart the editor. Note the console command
`culture = en` is NOT sufficient — it does not affect blueprint node display names
(details in `references/ue_conventions.md` §10).

## Platform support

| | Windows | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Editor launch | `UnrealEditor.exe` | `.app` inner binary — see `references/platform-macos.md` |
| Helper scripts | PowerShell twins (`.ps1`) | Python twins (`.py`, stdlib only) |
| MCP layer | identical (port 8000, HTTP JSON-RPC) | identical |

## Language

Skill content is English-first with Chinese trigger phrases preserved (the skill was built in a mixed zh/en workflow — Chinese users get native phrasing like "连不上/帮我打开项目"). Contributions in either language are welcome.

## Contributing

The skill self-maintains: failures that get diagnosed + verified are promoted into law entries (see *Self-Maintenance Protocol* in SKILL.md). PRs that add `[VERIFIED]` lessons from real PIE runs are the most valuable.
